# Neural-Network-from-Scratch
This project implements a basic feedforward neural network using only Python and NumPy â€” no high-level machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal is to understand the core mechanics of how neural networks learn, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates via gradient descent.
